# scale-communication

This repository cotains my approach to reverse engineer and implement the protocol
for communication with a "Crenot Gofit S2" scale in Python by using Bleak.

Currently the code only discovers available BLE devices and connects to a device
with the name "Crenot Gofit S2" (if available).
